# MSE-
Modications to the MSE Program. 

These modifications were made to add "assessment frequency". In addition, some proprietary libraies were unavialable and their references have been replaced with those found in the C++ standard library. Mainly random number and statistical distribution functions found in the Rogue Wave library have been replaced.

The MSE input file now has an additional field:

ASSESSMENT FREQUENCY

For example:

ASSESSMENT FREQUENCY<br>
3

will only analyze every three years found in the input file.
